	\chapter{Introduction}
		This (very) short document shows how to use the HMGU corporate design for reports with \LaTeX{}. It uses the standard report class and allows to quickly presents research within a scientific report. The requisites and the available commands are listed in the following sections.
		
		Reports must be compiled with \texttt{latex} command: bad output results will occur with other commands (e.g. \texttt{pdflatex}), especially on colors in chapter titles.
		
		This document corresponds to the version in date of \today. For all additional information, for bug report, or for suggestion, please send an email to \texttt{\url{julien.pontabry@helmholtz-muenchen.de}}.
	
	\chapter{Requisites}
			In order to get a function template, the following packages are mandatory:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \texttt{geometry} to manage the geometry of the page;
				\item \texttt{babel} to get correct translations (english);
				\item \texttt{ifdraft} to know if the user switch to draft and then not plotting loaded data;
				\item \texttt{verbatim} to display code;
				\item \texttt{lmodern} to have modern font typefaces;
				\item \texttt{microtype} to improve the typography of the document;
				\item \texttt{color} to have colors;
				\item \texttt{url} to be able to display URLs and breaking them when needed;
				\item \texttt{enumitem} to have custom enumerations;
				\item \texttt{titlesec} for customizing the chapter titles;
				\item \texttt{fix-cm} to allow for directly change some fonts;
				\item \texttt{fancyhdr} for custom headers and footers;
				\item \texttt{graphicx} for the display of images and logos;
				\item \texttt{caption} and \texttt{subcaption} to have custom caption for figures and subfigures;
				\item \texttt{tikz} for drawing (the tikz library \texttt{plotmarks} is required);
				\item \texttt{multirow} to allow multiple rows in tables;
				\item \texttt{pgfplotstable} to manage data tables loaded directly from CSV files;
				\item \texttt{pgfplots} to plot data directly from CSV files (pgfplots libraries \texttt{units} and \texttt{groupplots} are required as well);
				\item AMS packages for beautiful equations (\texttt{amsmath}, \texttt{amssymb}, \texttt{amsfonts}, etc.);
				\item \texttt{xfrac} to get nice fractions display;
				\item \texttt{booktabs}, \texttt{array} and \texttt{siunitx} for number and units formating;
				\item \texttt{algorithm2e} to have nice algorithms;
				\item \texttt{biblatex} for bibliography management;
				\item \texttt{hyperref} for PDF formating;
				\item \texttt{breakurl} for nice URLs formating within a PDF;
				\item \texttt{cleveref} for cross-references management.
			\end{itemize}

			To get a proper output of this document, the file \textit{hmgu-report.sty} is mandatory because it contains all the command and formating instructions. The image file \textit{hmgu\_color\_englisch.eps} is necessary as well for the logo.
	
	\chapter{Available commands}
		In addition to all \LaTeX{} commands used for writing a report, the following are available:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \verb|\subtitle| to write a subtitle on the first page;
			\item \verb|\institute| to display the name of the institute on the first page;
			\item \verb|\affiliationlogo| for the display of the logo of \emph{Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen} on the first page;
			\item all the commands coming with packages (e.g. \verb|\si| coming with \texttt{siunitx} for unit display).
		\end{itemize}
