	% Text
	Dear Madam, Mister,

	\newpart

	the \LaTeX{} version of the template for HMGU-styled letter is configurable with the following elements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$institute\{\textit{name}\}} identify the name of the institute (or department);
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$expeditor\{\textit{title}\}\{\textit{first-name}\}\{\textit{last-name}\}\{\dots\}} identify the author of the letter and is written in the margin;
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$adress\{\dots\}} contains the address of the lab;
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$recipient\{\dots\}} contains information about the recipient (name, compagny or lab, address, etc.);
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$newpart} creates a large vertical space to separate parts of the letter;
		\item \texttt{$\backslash{}$newparagraph} creates a small vertical space to separate paragraphs in the letter;
		\item you can change the date by using the standard \texttt{$\backslash{}$date} command (use \texttt{$\backslash$today} for current date).
	\end{itemize}

	\newparagraph

	This document needs the HMGU logo (file \textit{hmgu\_color\_englisch.eps}) and the following packages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{fontenc} to create PDF with correct fonts (packages \textit{cm-super} or \textit{lmodern} are required to get a good result);
		\item \textit{graphicx} to display images (here logos);
		\item \textit{fancyhdr} to be able to modify headers and footers;
		\item \textit{color} to provide colored fonts;
		\item \textit{ifthen} to manage conditions;
		\item \textit{helvet} to write with Helvetica font;
		\item \textit{babel} with the english option to take into account the particularities of the language.
	\end{itemize}
	The file named \textit{hmgu-style.tex} is mandatory: it contains all the custom commands needed for compilation.

	\newparagraph

	Logos are included in EPS format. Therefore, the compilation has to be done with the following commands: \texttt{latex}, \texttt{dvitops} et \texttt{pstopdf}.

	\newparagraph

	This document corresponds to the version in date of \today. For all additional information, for bug report, or for suggestion, please send an email to julien.pontabry@helmholtz-muenchen.de.

	Your sincerely,

	\newpart

	Dr. Julien Pontabry
